# TODOLIST APPLICATION DEVELOPED USING DOMAIN DRIVEN DESIGN MODEL

# Added Basic Rest Soervice to Create/Update/Delete Todo list 

Endpoints Exposed are:

GET     /todo/getAll 

GET     /todo/getToDo/{id}

POST    /todo/createToDo 

DELETE  /todo/deleteToDo/{id} 

PUT     /todo/updateToDo/{id}

# Payload format adding a new ToDo is:
Eg:{
        "name": "TODO2",
        "description": "My tasks",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "name":" push service changes",
                "description": "Give PR in feature branch"
            },
            {
                "name": "Take cristae to vet clinic"
                "description": "Today is cristae's de-worming day"
            },
                "name": "Need to Pay E-bill"
                "description": "Today is due date for the electricity bill"
            }
        ]
}

# NOTE: Currently there is no specific DB implementation for saving todo's data yet. Will update this in future. Important aspect is to develop using domain model rather than anaemic model.

# Technology:
1)For this demo used Dropwizard to create Restful services as it is a light-weight framework


# How to Run this application:
1)Go to project folder and run this command:
	>>>> mvn clean package
2)Once this done you will see a BUILD SUCCESS message, after that run this fat jar generated by the above command
	>>>> java -jar target/TodoList-1.0.jar  server
	
if everything goes correct then will get below response:
"INFO  [2019-12-22 19:09:01,961] org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: Started @1980ms"
